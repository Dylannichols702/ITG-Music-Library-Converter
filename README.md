# ITG-Music-Library-Converter
A command line utility that converts ITG charts to .mp3 files with populated metadata

## Command Line Arguments

I'm using Ubuntu 20.04 for running the example here:

```./converter.exe [PACK PATH] [DESTINATION PATH]```

This command will take iterate through the song folders in the song pack and create their appropriate .mp3 conversions.

NOTE: The current release only works on Linux, Windows users will have to install the necessary packages to build it themselves while I work on including a Windows build.
